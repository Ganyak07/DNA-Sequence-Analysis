## Usage

### Downloading DNA Sequencing Data

To download the DNA sequencing data, run the following Python script:

```python
import requests

url = "https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/ads1/data/lambda_virus.fa"
response = requests.get(url)
with open("lambda_virus.fa", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

Analyzing DNA Sequences
Counting Pattern Occurrences
To count the occurrences of a specific pattern in the DNA sequence, you can use the following function:


def count_pattern_occurrences(genome, pattern):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
Finding Approximate Matches
To find approximate matches of a pattern in the DNA sequence with a specified number of mismatches, you can use the following function:

python
Copy code
def find_approximate_match(genome, pattern, max_mismatches):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
Analyzing FASTQ Files
To analyze FASTQ files and identify problematic sequencing cycles, you can use the following functions:

def read_fastq(filename):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

def find_bad_cycle(qualities):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
Examples
Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the functions provided in this project:

# Example usage of count_pattern_occurrences
pattern = "AGGT"
count_aggt = count_pattern_occurrences(genome, pattern)
print("Total occurrences of AGGT:", count_aggt)
python
Copy code
# Example usage of find_approximate_match
pattern = "AGGAGGTT"
offset = find_approximate_match(genome, pattern, 2)
print("Offset of the leftmost occurrence of AGGAGGTT with up to 2 mismatches:", offset)
